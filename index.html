    <h2>Orbitron</h2>
    <p>Orbitron is a place where space is much favoured. Space, a boundless, three-dimensional continuum, is where objects can have relative positions, directions and size. Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure. In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit sound between them. Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies. No one knows exactly how big space is. It's difficult to determine because of what we can see in our detectors.<br> <br>We measure long distances in space in "light-years," representing the distance it takes for light to travel in a year. From the light that is visible in our telescopes, we have charted galaxies reaching almost as far back as the Big Bang, which is thought to have started our universe about 13.8 billion years ago. This means we can "see" into space at a distance of almost 13.8 billion light-years. But the universe continues to expand, making "measuring space," even more challenging.
